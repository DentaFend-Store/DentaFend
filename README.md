<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>How Does DentaFend Works?</strong></h2>
<p>Here's a short explanation on how these plants, herbs and minerals work and why they are so powerful.</p>
<p><strong>STAGE 1 - Flush out the toxins that have been damaging your teeth and gums</strong></p>
<p>The unique ingredients in the exact right combination are the most powerful way to fight off the toxins destroying your teeth and gums. First, the Bentonite clay acts as a molecular sponge, absorbing toxins and neutralizing bacteria and impurities from your mouth and teeth. Next, the Flaxseed is an extremely potent antioxidant that can fight off these dangerous toxins in your blood and clear the way for teeth and gum rejuvenation. It also helps decrease inflammation and regulate blood sugar levels. Finally, the Oat bran has a natural ability to trace bad bacteria colonies and toxins, annihilating them while stopping bleeding and inflammation on the gum level.</p>
<p><strong>STAGE 2 - Your teeth and gums start to repair</strong></p>
<p>The addition of Black walnut supercharges the teeth and gum repairing process. Black walnuts are rich in ellagitannins which have powerful anti-inflammatory and free-radical-fighting properties in the body. This provides strong antioxidant and antibacterial effects to keep your teeth and gums clean, healthy, and strong.</p>
<p><strong>STAGE 3 - Create an impenetrable shield against bad bacteria and teeth destroying toxins</strong></p>
<p>The Aloe vera gel contains potent antioxidants that belong to the polyphenol family. It helps fight gum disease and destroy plaque and calculus. With no more toxins in your body, you'll be free from infections and live a stress-free life.</p>
